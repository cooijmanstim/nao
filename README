These qiBuild projects are the results of my messings-around with Nao robots.

  * The RandomWalk module makes the Nao walk around randomly by repeatedly calling ALMotion::moveTo(x, y, theta) with x, y and theta sampled from a uniform distribution.
  * The Observer module hooks into ALMotion's preprocess and postprocess steps to record sensor and actuator data (i.e. MDP state-action pairs).
  * The Controller program connects to a Naoqi and invokes Observer and RandomWalk to gather data on what is going on as the robot walks around.

You will need to modify the CMakeLists.txt files to make sure your compiler can find the libraries and headers.
